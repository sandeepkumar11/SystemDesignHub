# Requirements for a Notification Service

The following requirements outline the functional and non-functional aspects of designing a Notification Service. The service is responsible for sending notifications to users through multiple channels (e.g., email, SMS, push notifications) in a scalable, reliable, and extensible manner. These requirements serve as the foundation for creating a detailed LLD.

## Functional Requirements

### Notification Channels

- **Support multiple notification channels:**
  - **Email:** Send notifications via email (e.g., using SMTP or third-party services like SendGrid).
  - **SMS:** Send text messages via SMS gateways (e.g., Twilio).
  - **Push Notifications:** Send mobile push notifications (e.g., via Firebase Cloud Messaging or Apple Push Notification Service).
- Allow easy addition of new channels (e.g., WhatsApp, in-app notifications) in the future.

### Notification Types

- **Support different types of notifications:**
  - **Transactional:** Critical notifications (e.g., order confirmation, password reset).
  - **Promotional:** Marketing messages (e.g., discounts, campaigns).
  - **Alerts:** Time-sensitive updates (e.g., account activity, system warnings).
- Allow categorization of notifications for prioritization and processing.

### Triggering Notifications

- **Enable notifications to be triggered via:**
  - **API Calls:** External services can send notifications through RESTful or gRPC APIs.
  - **Event-Driven:** Listen to events from a message queue (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ) for asynchronous triggering.
- Support both real-time and scheduled notifications (e.g., send a reminder at a specific time).

### Template Management

- Provide a mechanism to define and manage notification templates for each channel.
- Support dynamic content substitution (e.g., user name, order ID) in templates.
- Allow template updates without service downtime.

### User Preferences

- Allow users to configure notification preferences (e.g., opt-in/opt-out for promotional notifications, preferred channels).
- Respect user preferences when sending notifications (e.g., do not send SMS if opted out).

### Retry Mechanism

- Implement retries for failed notification attempts (e.g., temporary network issues with third-party services).
- Support configurable retry policies (e.g., number of retries, exponential backoff).

### Logging and Tracking

- Log all notification attempts (success, failure, retry) with relevant metadata (e.g., user ID, channel, timestamp).
- Provide a mechanism to track notification status (e.g., sent, delivered, opened) where applicable (e.g., email open tracking).

### Bulk Notifications

- Support sending notifications to multiple users in bulk (e.g., promotional campaigns to thousands of users).
- Ensure efficient processing to avoid delays in bulk scenarios.

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Scalability

- Handle high volumes of notifications (e.g., millions per day) with horizontal scaling.
- Support load balancing across multiple instances of the service.

### Reliability

- Ensure notifications are delivered reliably, with minimal loss.
- Implement fault tolerance to handle failures in third-party services or internal components.
- Provide mechanisms for deduplication of notifications to avoid sending the same message multiple times.
- Implement a dead-letter queue for undeliverable notifications after retries.

### Performance

- Achieve low latency for real-time notifications (e.g., <1 second for transactional alerts).
- Process bulk notifications efficiently without impacting real-time performance.

### Availability

- Maintain high availability (e.g., 99.9% uptime) to ensure notifications are sent promptly.
- Use redundancy and failover mechanisms to handle outages.

### Extensibility

- Design the system to easily integrate new notification channels or third-party providers.
- Allow modular addition of features (e.g., new template types, analytics).

### Security

- Secure sensitive data (e.g., user details, notification content) using encryption (at rest and in transit).
- Authenticate and authorize API requests to prevent unauthorized access.
- Comply with data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) for user data handling.

### Maintainability

- Ensure the codebase is modular and well-documented for easy updates.
- Provide monitoring and logging for debugging and performance tracking.

### Cost Efficiency

- Optimize usage of third-party services (e.g., minimize API calls to SMS gateways).
- Support cost-effective scaling for high-volume scenarios.

## Constraints

### Third-Party Dependencies

- Rely on external services (e.g., SendGrid, Twilio, Firebase) for actual delivery, which may introduce latency or downtime risks.
- Handle rate limits and quotas imposed by third-party providers.

### Data Volume

- Manage large datasets for user preferences, templates, and logs without performance degradation.
- Ensure efficient storage and retrieval for high-frequency operations.

### Regulatory Compliance

- Adhere to regional regulations for notifications (e.g., opt-in requirements for SMS in certain countries).
- Implement mechanisms to handle user consent and data deletion requests.

### Cross-Channel Consistency

- Ensure consistent messaging across channels (e.g., same content for email and SMS).
- Handle channel-specific limitations (e.g., SMS character limits).

## Assumptions

### Infrastructure

- The service will run on a cloud-based infrastructure (e.g., AWS, GCP) with access to managed databases, queues, and monitoring tools.
- A message queue system (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ) is available for event-driven notifications.

### User Data

- User data (e.g., email addresses, phone numbers, push tokens) is available in a database or via API.
- User preferences are stored and accessible in real-time.

### Third-Party Services

- Reliable third-party services are available for each notification channel.
- APIs for third-party services provide status tracking (e.g., delivery receipts).

### Development Scope

- The initial implementation focuses on email, SMS, and push notifications, with plans for future expansion.
- In-house notification delivery (e.g., SMTP server for email) is out of scope.

## Success Criteria

### Functional

- Successfully send notifications across all supported channels with >99% delivery rate.
- Accurately respect user preferences and regulatory requirements.
- Handle bulk notifications for 100,000 users within 10 minutes.

### Non-Functional

- Achieve <1-second latency for real-time transactional notifications.
- Scale to handle 1 million notifications per day without performance degradation.
- Maintain 99.9% uptime, with no single point of failure.

### Operational

- Provide dashboards for monitoring notification success/failure rates.
- Enable debugging of failed notifications within 5 minutes using logs.

These requirements provide a clear and comprehensive foundation for designing a notification service in a system design exercise. They cover the essential functionality, performance expectations, and constraints to guide the creation of a robust system.
